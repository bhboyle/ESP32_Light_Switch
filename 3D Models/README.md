# Using the file

The file here is a Fusion 360 file. You will need to install and activate Fusion 360 to work with the model. 

The one file contains all of the individual bodies for the first version of the housing and buttons. I usually hide the item that I don't want to print and then go use Fusion to send the file to Cura for 3D printing.
